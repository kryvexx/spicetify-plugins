# spicetify-plugins
Collection of my own Spicetify plugins, all free to use. Don't skid, or at least credit my work >:(
##### (Since my dumbass doesn't know how to upload extensions to the marketplace, I will provide installers for each plugin)

## Extensions:
- [**AutoPlaylist**](https://github.com/kryvexx/spicetify-plugins/blob/main/AutoPlaylist/README.md)
  - Automatically opens a playlist at Spotify's startup (not reloads)
  - **Installer**:
    ```ps1
    iwr -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kryvexx/spicetify-plugins/refs/heads/main/AutoPlaylist/install.ps1" | iex
    ```
